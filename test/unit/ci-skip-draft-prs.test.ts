// Regression guard: draft PRs were consuming the exact same 11-job GitHub-hosted-runner fan-out as ready
// PRs (validate-code, the 6-way validate-tests shard matrix, validate-tests-merge, security), which both
// (a) let contributors farm bot labels/AI review/screenshots for free while sitting in draft, and (b)
// materially worsened the account's shared-runner queue contention for every other PR in flight. The heavy
// jobs now require the PR not be a draft; the cheap `changes` and `validate` (result-aggregation) jobs still
// run unconditionally since `validate` already treats a skipped dependency as success.
