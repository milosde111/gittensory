// Repo-doc PR delivery (#3000/#3004, part of the repo-doc generation roadmap #2993). Turns a rendered AGENTS.md
// body (src/review/repo-doc-render.ts, itself derived from src/review/repo-profile.ts) into an actual pull
// request against the target repo -- branch + commit + PR-open, reusing the SAME installation-token write
// chokepoint (makeInstallationOctokit) every other GitHub write in this engine goes through. Never a direct
// commit to the target repo's default branch: AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md are always delivered as a PR.
//
// DIFF-AWARE REFRESH (#3004): before building anything, the CURRENT AGENTS.md on the default branch (if any) is
// fetched and run through src/review/generated-doc-refresh.ts's marker-block refresh. That call is the single
// source of truth for what happens next -- a first-run repo gets the full generated content, a repo whose
// generated section is unchanged gets NO pull request at all (no-op), a repo whose generated section changed
// gets a pull request with everything outside the markers preserved byte-for-byte, and a repo whose marker
// block is missing or malformed gets neither a silent overwrite nor a guess -- just a reported reason.
//
// CONFIG-AS-CODE GATE (#3002): this whole feature is opt-in per repo via `.loopover.yml repoDocGeneration:`
// (src/signals/focus-manifest.ts) -- a manifest-only surface with no DB-backed counterpart, since there is no
// dashboard toggle for it. `enabled`/`scope` are checked BEFORE any profile extraction or GitHub call (the
// common case is disabled, so this must be cheap); `allowOverwriteExisting` is checked later, once refresh
// reports `manual-review-required` (the "this file looks hand-maintained" signal), and lets that specific case
// proceed as a fresh wholesale generate instead of skipping.
//
// SKILL FILE, ADDITIVE (#3001): when `.loopover.yml repoDocGeneration.scope` includes `"skills"` AND the repo
// profile's contribution workflow warrants one (src/review/repo-skill-render.ts's shouldGenerateRepoSkill), a
// generated skill file rides along in the SAME commit/PR as AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md -- there is no parallel
// delivery path. It gets its OWN marker pair and its own refreshGeneratedDoc call (reused unchanged, per that
// module's own design intent), so a skill-only content change can still open a PR even when AGENTS.md itself
// is unchanged, and a skill-file conflict (manual-review-required without the overwrite opt-in) only excludes
// the skill from this run rather than blocking the AGENTS.md refresh it rode in with.

## What this is

\`AGENTS.md\`, generated from a profile of ${repoFullName}'s own code -- its indexed file layout, naming and test-file conventions, build/test/lint commands, and contribution-workflow settings (whether CI publishes a required check, the linked-issue policy, and indexed CI workflow files). \`CLAUDE.md\` is kept in sync with it (as a symlink where the platform supports one, otherwise an identical copy), so the two never drift apart.${skillParagraph}

## Why it looks like this

Every fact above was read directly from this repository, not templated or guessed. If something looks wrong, it most likely means the underlying signal doesn't represent this repo well -- edit the generated file directly on this branch (or after merging) rather than filing an issue against Gittensory.

## Opting out

Set \`repoDocGeneration.enabled: false\` in this repository's \`.loopover.yml\` (or simply close this pull request) -- no further action is taken until it is re-enabled.
