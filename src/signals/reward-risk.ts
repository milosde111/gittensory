// Reward/risk reasoning signals, extracted to `@loopover/engine` (#2281) so the gittensory-miner
// can rank candidate work locally with the same logic the maintainer-side gate computes. The implementation
// lives at `packages/loopover-engine/src/reward-risk.ts`, imported via its RELATIVE SOURCE PATH (matching
// the merged #2276/#2278/#2282 shims) — not the published `@loopover/engine` specifier, so no
// tsconfig path / vitest alias / root dependency is introduced.
//
// This is a WRAPPING shim rather than the usual pure `export *` re-export. reward-risk depends on the
// maintainer signal stack (`buildRoleContext`, `buildLaneAdvice`, `buildCollisionReport`, `buildQueueHealth`,
// `buildRepoFitRecommendation`, `buildContributorIntakeHealth`, `buildPullRequestReviewIntelligence`) which
// now lives in `@loopover/engine` (#4884). `isFailingCheckSummary` also lives in `@loopover/engine` (#4256).
// The engine module still takes the builders as an injected `RewardRiskEngineDeps`; this shim binds the real
// engine implementations and threads them in, so every existing importer keeps calling the four builders with
// their original signatures.
