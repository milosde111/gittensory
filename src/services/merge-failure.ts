// RC3 terminal-fail merges. A merge mutation that fails for one of these reasons can NEVER complete for the

// mark the PR terminally merge-blocked (held for a human) instead of looping forever.
//
//   • 401 Bad credentials → the installation token was rejected: the App was suspended or its private key was
//     rotated mid-flight. withInstallationTokenRetry (src/github/app.ts) already evicts-and-retries ONCE on a
//     401 inside the merge call itself, so a 401 reaching HERE means that retry also failed — a genuinely,
//     persistently unauthorized installation, not a one-off stale-token race. Burning the full MERGE_RETRY_CAP
//     against the same known-bad credential wastes calls for nothing; fail fast instead (#2264).
//   • 403 Resource not accessible by integration → GitHub returned a generic branch-protection / ruleset /
//     installation-visibility rejection. The executor already checked the concrete App permissions before the
//     merge call, so this is retryable first: required checks, conversation resolution, and permission snapshots
//     can converge shortly after the review/check publication boundary.
//   • 405 Method Not Allowed → merge not allowed (e.g. required reviews/checks policy forbids an App merge).
//   • 409 Conflict → a required status check is absent / head moved into a non-mergeable state.
//   • merge-conflict text → the branch genuinely conflicts with base; only the contributor can resolve it.
//
// A failure that matches none of these is treated as POSSIBLY transient (e.g. "Base branch was modified" — a
// benign TOCTOU race that a re-attempt against the new base resolves), so the executor retries it up to
// MERGE_RETRY_CAP before escalating to the same terminal hold.
