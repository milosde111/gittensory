// Public "Decision accuracy %" weekly trend (#4447, part of epic #4445). The homepage already shows a LIVE,
// lifetime accuracyPct (public-stats.ts's own reversal-grounded formula: 1 - reversed/(merged+closed), over the
// SAME own-ledger allowlist + registered Orb fleet the rest of that payload uses) but no history, so there's no
// way to see whether accuracy is improving, stable, or degrading.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT a persisted/cron rollup: `audit_events`, `pull_requests`, and `orb_pr_outcomes` are already
// durable, so a live weekly re-bucketing of those SAME rows (mirroring buildPublicQualityTrend's already-shipped
// #2568 pattern for the sibling per-repo quality trend) can recompute any historical week correctly on every
// request -- no cron-miss gap risk, no second copy of the number to keep in sync, and the SAME formula as the
// live figure by construction, so the two can never silently diverge or read as inconsistent to a public viewer.
