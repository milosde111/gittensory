// Bin-packs the full test/**/*.test.ts file set into N balanced shards by historical duration (greedy
// LPT -- Longest Processing Time first: sort files descending by duration, repeatedly assign the next
// file to whichever shard currently has the smallest total), replacing vitest's own --shard (file
// COUNT only, no duration awareness -- confirmed this session via real per-shard CI timing data to
// produce a consistent ~20-30% gap between the slowest and fastest of 6 shards, every sampled run).
//
// Deliberately scoped to the full-suite case only -- see ci.yml's "Test with coverage" step for how
// this output is (and is NOT) consumed. A PR using scoped test selection (--changed=origin/main)
// keeps vitest's own native --shard: that file set isn't known until vitest resolves --changed
// itself, so a precomputed assignment can't apply to it without duplicating vitest's own dependency-
// graph resolution here.
//
// HARD INVARIANT, checked before any output is written: the union of every shard's file list must
// equal EXACTLY the discovered test file set, with no file in more than one shard. A violation means
// this script would make CI silently never run some test file at all -- exactly the failure class that
// this whole session's Codecov-enforcement work exists to prevent, just introduced by the tool meant
// to speed that same pipeline up. This refuses to write ANY output if the invariant doesn't hold,
// rather than risk it: a hard failure here (a broken CI step everyone sees) is a wildly better outcome
// than a silent one (missing coverage nobody notices until something ships broken).
